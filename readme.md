## Initial ideas
- developers should be able to use framework to create micro-services using Restful APIs
- developers can create CRUD APIs very quickly such POST, PUT, UPDATE and UPDATE
- these APIs can process entire lifecycle of http request and response
- we should provide functionality for developers to introduce additional processes such as authinetication into these these APIs
